## 💡 About the modules

All projects in this repository are developed using strict C++98 standard, without any newer language features.  
The Orthodox Canonical Form (implementing default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor) is emphasized and required in **Module 02** and onwards.

Below are short descriptions of each module (00 to 09):

---

### 🟦 Module 00: Basic C++ Syntax & OOP Introduction

> _Introduction to C++ syntax, data types, namespaces, and basic object-oriented programming. Focuses on understanding compilation, headers, and basic class structures._

---

### 🟦 Module 01: Memory Allocation & References

> _Covers dynamic memory allocation (heap vs stack), references, pointers, and basic resource management. Emphasizes the importance of constructors, destructors, and memory safety._

---

### 🟦 Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism - Operator Overloading

> _Introduces operator overloading, function overloading, and basic usage of templates. Focuses on creating user-friendly classes and utilities with custom operators._

---

### 🟦 Module 03: Inheritance, Polymorphism, & Orthodox Canonical Form

> _Explores inheritance (single and multiple), access specifiers, and polymorphic behavior. **Orthodox Canonical Form** (default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor) is a key requirement for all main classes._

---

### 🟦 Module 04: Abstract Classes & Interfaces

> _Deep dive into abstract classes, pure virtual functions, interfaces, and runtime polymorphism. OCF compliance continues to be crucial for robust, reusable code._

---

### 🟦 Module 05: Exception Handling

> _Introduces C++ exception handling using try/catch blocks, custom exception classes, and safe error propagation. Emphasizes robust and maintainable code._

---

### 🟦 Module 06: Casts & Serialization

> _Covers type casting (static, dynamic, const, reinterpret), serialization basics, and safe conversions. Practices advanced manipulation of object types and memory._

---

### 🟦 Module 07: Templates & Iterators

> _Introduces class and function templates, STL containers, and iterators. Encourages generic programming and code reuse with type-safe abstractions._

---

### 🟦 Module 08: Templated Containers & Algorithms

> _Deepens understanding of STL containers (vector, stack, map, etc.) and standard algorithms. Focuses on efficient data manipulation and algorithm design in modern C++._

---

### 🟦 Module 09: Smart Pointers, Modern C++ Features & Ford-Johnson Algorithm

> _Explores smart pointers, resource management patterns, and implements the **Ford-Johnson algorithm (Merge-Insertion Sort)** as a main challenge. All solutions are crafted in C++98._

## 🛠️ Usage
Each module is a standalone project. To compile and run a module, navigate to its directory and use:

```shell
$ make
./<executable>
```

## 📚 What I Learned
- C++ syntax and best practices under C++98 constraints
- Orthodox Canonical Form (OCF) and its importance in class design
- Object-oriented programming and design patterns
- Memory management and resource safety
- Exception handling and robust code structure
- Advanced C++ features and STL usage
- Ford-Johnson (Merge-Insertion) algorithm (Module 09) where I improved my coding skills implementing a complex algorithm
